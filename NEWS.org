* v0.3.0 A New Hope
Nearly a complete rewrite.  After figuring out what belongs in dslide, this package has become more clearly defined.

The ~mc-focus~ command remains the focal point.  Many of the tools like setting the size, hiding the cursor, or changing faces all serve to enhance ~mc-focus~.

⚠️ The naming and features have undergone heavy renaming and stuff.  Don't expect anything to be exactly the same from 0.2.0.  That version was unmaintained on Github for a while as my changes were only localy evolving.
** Added
- ~mc-dispatch~ to control all the things
** Changed
- ~mc-face-remap~ is the old org mode remapping.  This version is flexible for all situations and supports multiple preset profiles
** Removed
- Everything related specifically to org mode like hiding markup
** Fixed
- Well, a lot more was fixed than is newly broken.  0.2.0 was barely a package at all
